# Brain-Drone Race Line Detection

The Brain-Drone Race is a competition featuring users' cognitive ability and mental endurance. During this event competitors are required to out-focus opponents in a drone drag race influenced by electrical signals emitted from the brain.

This python class is designed to facilitate the detection of the line which the drones will follow. It allows for the analysis of an image, returning an error to represent the drone's deviation from the line. This system uses methodologies such as Gaussian blur, color-based filtering, Canny Edge Detection, and Hough Line Transform.

This BDR Line Detection class is developed by the Human Technology Interaction Lab at the University of Alabama.
